Step 1:
Our program will store the users input using scanf.
This is a control parameter that is used in various functions to specify the layout of an input string.
The parameters it will take are words that begin with capital letters you can put as many trailing white spaces as you wish.

Step 2.
We will declare our function using a function prototype.
The function we are going to be making is one that checks if the start of each word has a capital letter and gets rid of trailing whitespaces.
We use function prototypes to tell the compiler about the required datatypes of a function parameter. 
It also tells us about the return type of the function.

Step 3.
Our function must return boolean values since it is checking to see if each word has a capital letter so we can differentiate the start and end the inputs.

Step 4:
When we get our input our program must read in the list of words.
Once it reads it in we will remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.

Step 5.
We are assuming that the words the user puts will always start with a capital letter. 
This will determine the start and end of the word so we can successfully extract it and put it on a new line.

Step 6.
When done our program will output:
John
Jack
Jill
